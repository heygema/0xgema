This cheat sheet provides a personal random list of Docker commands. 

### Basic Commands

Here are some basic Docker commands that you can use to manage your Docker containers.

```bash
docker run --name [container-name] -d -p [host-port]:[container-port] [image-name] /bin/sh -c "while true; do ping 8.8.8.8; done"
```

This command runs a Docker container with the specified name, image, and port mapping. The container runs a command that continuously pings an IP address (in this case, 8.8.8.8).

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```

This command stops all running Docker containers.

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

This command removes all stopped Docker containers.

```bash
docker exec -it [container-name] /bin/bash
```

This command opens a shell inside a running Docker container.

### PostgreSQL Configuration

PostgreSQL is a popular database management system that can be run in Docker. Here are some Docker commands to create a new PostgreSQL instance and mount to an outside volume.

```bash
docker run --name [container-name] \
           --env POSTGRES_USER=[username] \
           --env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=[password] \
           --publish 127.0.0.1:[host-port]:5432 \
           --detach \
           --restart unless-stopped \
           postgres:13
```

This command creates a new PostgreSQL instance with the specified username, password, and port mapping.

```bash
docker run --name [container-name] -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=[password] -e POSTGRES_USER=[username] -e POSTGRES_DB=[database-name] -v ~/data/[volume-name]:/var/lib/postgresql/data -d
```

This command creates a new PostgreSQL instance with the specified username, password, database name, and volume mount.

### Elastic Configuration

Elasticsearch is a popular search engine that can also be run in Docker. Here is a Docker command to run a single-node Elasticsearch instance.

```bash
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.15.1
```

This command runs a single-node Elasticsearch instance with the specified port mappings and configuration.

### Conclusion

Docker can be a powerful tool for developers, but it can also be overwhelming to navigate through the various commands and configurations. This cheat sheet provides a comprehensive list of Docker commands and configurations to help you get started with Docker.
