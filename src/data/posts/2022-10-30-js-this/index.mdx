excerpt: Javascript this binding quick explainer

---

Let me share what I have on `this`. Please correct me if I am wrong in any of this.

##  Implicit Binding

Implicit Binding occurs upon the creation of the object. When a function is invoked from an object after a . (dot), the `this` inside the scope of the function will refers to the object that calls it.

```js
const me = {
  name: 'X',
  sayName: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

// this is the `me`
me.sayName()
```

but in case of arrow function

```js
() => {}
let you = {name: 'you', sayName: () => {console.log(this.name)}} // undefined
```

this is because arrow function by default binds `this`, to the scope where it was created, in this case if it's in the browser, the window object. if it was this case:

```js
function createYou(name) {this.name=name, this.sayName = () => {console.log(this.name)}}

let you = new createYou("a person");
you.sayName(); // "a person"
```

but you cannot rebind it anywhere after it was defined

> You cannot rebind `this` in an arrow function. It will always be defined as the context in which it was defined. If you require this to be meaningful you should use a normal function. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33308121/can-you-bind-this-in-an-arrow-function)

##  Explicit Binding

We can explicitly tells javascript to bind to an object (everything in JS is an Object anyway) available using three types of methods _call_,  _apply_, and  _bind_

**call**
```javascript
const me = {
  name: 'Stacey'
}

function hello(address, address2, address3) {
  console.log("hello ", this.name, ", ", address, ", " , address2, ", ", address3);
}

hello.call(me, "Hollywood", address2)
```

**apply**
same as .call, but we can apply array of args
```javascript

let addresses = ["Malibu", "California", "New York"]

hello.apply(me, addresses);
```

**bind**
```javascript
const me = {
  name: 'Stacey'
}

function hello(address) {
  console.log("hello ", this.name, ", ", address);
}

let newHello = hello.bind(me, 'Hollywood')
neHello();

```

Others: 

##  using `new` 

```javascript

const Animal = function(name, type) {
  this.name = name;
  this.type = type;
}

let omnivore = new Animal("Jane", "Omnivore")

```


##  Default Window Binding

```javascript
/*
@example
if you don't want it to implicitly binds to window object or global. put use strict';
*/
const sayName = function() {
 'use strict';
 console.log(this.name);
}
const sayName = function() {
 console.log(this.name);
}
sayName();
```
