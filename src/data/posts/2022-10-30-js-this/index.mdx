`this` is a reference to the object that invokes the current function. In JavaScript, `this` can have different values depending on the context in which the function is invoked.

## Implicit Binding

In implicit binding, the value of this is set based on the object that invokes the function. For example:

```javascript
const me = {
  name: 'X',
  sayName: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

me.sayName(); // Output: X
```

However, the value of this in arrow functions is not determined by the object that invokes it. Instead, the value of this is set to the context in which the arrow function was created.

```javascript
const you = {name: 'you', sayName: () => console.log(this.name)};

you.sayName(); // Output: undefined

// The value of this in an arrow function cannot be rebound after it is defined.
```

## Explicit Binding

In explicit binding, you can set the value of this explicitly using methods like call, apply, and bind.

`call` allows you to pass arguments to the function and bind this to a specific object:

```javascript
const me = { name: 'Stacey' };

function hello(address, address2, address3) {
  console.log("Hello ", this.name, ", ", address, ", " , address2, ", ", address3);
}

hello.call(me, "Hollywood", "California", "New York");
```

`apply` is similar to call, but you pass the arguments as an array:

```javascript
const me = { name: 'Stacey' };

function hello(address, address2, address3) {
  console.log("Hello ", this.name, ", ", address, ", " , address2, ", ", address3);
}

const addresses = ["Malibu", "California", "New York"];

hello.apply(me, addresses);
```

`bind` allows you to bind this to a specific object and create a new function with a pre-bound this value:

```javascript
const me = { name: 'Stacey' };

function hello(address) {
  console.log("Hello ", this.name, ", ", address);
}

const newHello = hello.bind(me, 'Hollywood');

newHello();
```

`new` Operator
In JavaScript, the new operator creates a new instance of an object and binds this to the new object. For example:

```javascript
const Animal = function(name, type) {
  this.name = name;
  this.type = type;
};

const omnivore = new Animal("Jane", "Omnivore");
```

## Default Window Binding

By default, this is bound to the window object (or global in a non-browser environment). To avoid this behavior, you can add 'use strict'; at the beginning of your code.

```javascript
/*
@example
if you don't want it to implicitly binds to window object or global. put use strict';
*/
const sayName = function() {
 'use strict';
 console.log(this.name);
}

const sayName = function() {
 console.log(this.name);
}

sayName();
```
