# Welcome Visitors

My name is __Gema Anggada__, I've been working as a _Software Engineer_. Mostly I like UI/UX, spared little time experimenting with different frontend/backend frameworks, languages, ideas, and [mental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model). *Declarative* is a virtue. Also a *[minimalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism)*, overall __having fun__ with existence as much as possible and as I could. Worth to explore sometimes: [Nihilist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism), [Hedonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism), [Existentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism).

**Music of choice:** could be FKJ, [Belle Chen](https://soundcloud.com/bellechen/sets/belle-tower-subscribers/s-Hf1e69Fpis2), Beethoven, or Rimsky Korsakov sometimes, don't forget Metallica, Ghost, or Taylor Swift. Listen to [.feast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFT_7kZ86Q), cool alternative rock [Indonesians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesians) band.

**Gaming:** [Fallout 4](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/Fallout-4/C3KLDKZBHNCZ), [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/red-dead-redemption-2)

I share my personal [notes and writings](/) here and there, hopefully you find them useful even they're written by noob like me. Being noob is fun. Look at [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/blog), always delivers. His [wisdom](https://levels.io/100-days-of-shipping/) is Goood.

Life is short, too short in fact, the probability of being born as an [Insects of the order Blattodea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach) is higher than being born as a baby in a [Royal Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family), _unfair huh?_ And this site will be continuously upgraded, until life is [null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null).
