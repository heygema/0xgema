## 👋 Welcome Visitor(s)

My name is __Gema Anggada__, I've been working as a _Software Engineer_ for like. I like crafting UI/UX, spared little time experimenting with different frontend/backend frameworks, languages, ideas, and mental models. I like being a [minimalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism) and just _having fun_ with existence as much as possible and as I could. I share my personal [notes and writings](/) here and there, hopefully you find them useful.

This site is handcrafted using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), *stack:* [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vanilla Extract for CSS](https://vanilla-extract.style/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard). Design is heavily inspired by [ped.ro](https://ped.ro) and [emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/). __Other mentions:__ [sania.io](https://sania.io/), [nan.fyi](https://nan.fyi/). Check them out. Cool [wisdom](https://levels.io/100-days-of-shipping/) from [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/blog).
