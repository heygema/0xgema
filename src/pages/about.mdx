# Welcome Visitors

My name is __Gema__, I've been working as a _Software Engineer_. Mostly I like UI/UX, sparing little time experimenting with different frontend/backend frameworks, languages, ideas, and mental model. *Declarative* is a virtue. Also a *minimalist*, overall __having fun__ with existence as much as possible and as I could.

**Music of choice:** could be FKJ, Beethoven, or Rimsky Korsakov sometimes, don't forget Metallica, Ghost, or Taylor Swift. Listen to [.feast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFT_7kZ86Q), cool alternative rock [Indonesians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesians) band.

I share my personal [notes and writings](/) here and there, hopefully you find them useful even they're written by noob like me. Being noob is fun. Look at [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/blog), always delivers. His [wisdom](https://levels.io/100-days-of-shipping/) is Goood.
