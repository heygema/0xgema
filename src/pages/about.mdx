# Welcome Visitors

My name is __Gema__, I've been working as a _Software Engineer_. Mostly I like UI/UX, sparing little time experimenting with different frontend/backend frameworks, languages, ideas, and mental model. *Declarative* is a virtue. Also a *[minimalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism)*, overall __having fun__ with existence as much as possible and as I could. Worth to explore sometimes: [Nihilist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism), [Hedonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism), [Existentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism).

**Music of choice:** could be FKJ, Beethoven, or Rimsky Korsakov sometimes, don't forget Metallica, Ghost, or Taylor Swift. Listen to [.feast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBFT_7kZ86Q), cool alternative rock [Indonesians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesians) band.

I share my personal [notes and writings](/) here and there, hopefully you find them useful even they're written by noob like me. Being noob is fun. Look at [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/blog), always delivers. His [wisdom](https://levels.io/100-days-of-shipping/) is Goood.

This site design is heavily inspired by [Pedro Duarte](https://ped.ro) and [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski/). __Honorable mentions:__ [Sania Saleh](https://sania.io/), [Laura Gonzales](https://www.laura.monster/), [Nanda Syahrasyad](https://nan.fyi/). Check them out.

Life is short, too short in fact, the probability of being born as an [Insects of the order Blattodea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach) is higher than being born as a baby in a [Royal Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family), _unfair huh?_ And this site will be continuously upgraded, until life is [null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null).
