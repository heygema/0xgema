## Welcome Visitor(s)

My name is __Gema Anggada__, I've been working as a _Software Engineer_. Mostly I like UI/UX, spared little time experimenting with different frontend/backend frameworks, languages, ideas, and [mental models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model). Also a *[minimalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism)*, overall __having fun__ with existence as much as possible and as I could.

I share my personal [notes and writings](/) here and there, hopefully you find them useful even if they're written by a noob like me. Being a noob is fun. 

This site is handcrafted using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), *stack:* [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vanilla Extract for CSS](https://vanilla-extract.style/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard). Design is heavily inspired by [ped.ro](https://ped.ro) and [emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/). __Other mentions:__ [sania.io](https://sania.io/), [laura.monster](https://www.laura.monster/), [nan.fyi](https://nan.fyi/). Check them out. Another cool people to look at [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/blog), been following since 2015, always delivers. His [wisdom](https://levels.io/100-days-of-shipping/) is Goood.

Life is short, also the probability of being born as an [Insects of the order Blattodea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach) is higher than being born as a baby in a [Royal Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family), unfair. And this site will be continuously upgraded, until life is [null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null).
